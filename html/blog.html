				<h1>What is Technology?</h1>
				<p>Technology is the use of scientific knowledge to make human life easier and productive. Humans face different problems everyday. To solve this problem by using minimal effort and less time, technologies have been created. With each day passing by technologies are getting more advanced.</p>
				<br>
				<p>When we think of technology our mind makes us think that it is a complex object which runs on electricity, but technology can be simple as a wheel or it can be complex as a super computer.</p>
				<br>
				<h1>E-commerce</h1>
				<p>Electronic commerce also known as ecommerce is the buying and selling of goods on the internet. Sellers can list their goods and services on the internet and the customers can purchase it from there without the need of having to go outside their home.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-4">
				<h1>Impacts</h1>
				<h2>Positive Impacts</h2>
				<p>1. People can buy the things they want from their home just with the touch of their fingers.</p>
				<br>
				<p>2. They can shop at anytime they want. A store might not open 24/7 but a website opens 24/7.</p>
				<br>
				<p>3. It saves time and effort as the people dont have to keep on searching the item they want everywhere and they can even check the reviews from other customer, similar products, and the product description.</p>
				<br>
				<p>4. The sellers can sell their goods internationally and not limit to a local area.</p>
				<h2>Negative Impacts</h2>
				<p>1. It might not be always secure as the customers have to give their personal information and their credit/debit card informations.</p>
				<br>
				<p>2. People may not get their products on time or the quality of the product might not be as expected.</p>	
			</div>
			<div class="col-4">
				<p>3. It makes people more lazy as they don't need to visit the physical stores.</p>
				<br>
				<h1>Impact of technology while selling Bonsai</h1>
				<p>Bonsai are small trees, which is planted in pots and vase. So it takes up minimal space. Due to lack of space in peoples homes, many people prefer it. Before ecommerce was popular, people had to go to the specific bonsai stores to buy bonsai, which are kindof rare in different countries. For example, Nepal. So ecommerce has made it easier for both the buyers and sellers. As the sellers can list their products online and the buyers can purchase from there which has made it easier and faster.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The customers can know every detail of the bonsai before buying it so that they dont have to do more research on it. They can find every tools and information required to take care of the bonsai on the internet. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-4">
				<h1>Conclusion</h1>
				<p>With technologies getting more advanced each day and the user base increasing, it is safe to say that ecommerce can be the mode of shopping in the upcomming future. As people have started to get busier and there is lack of space in almost every city, the buyers dont have much time to spend roaming around every shop in the corner and the sellers cant afford the place for their store. Ecommerce has become the perfect solution for them.</p>
				<br>
				<p>It has given opportunities for the smaller startups and has made the large businesses grow even larger.</p>
